# closHomer
Code repository for the `closHomer` workflow to identify and characterise ecological trends (host and niche adaptation) in clostridial species.

The workflow is written in a series of Jupyter notebooks, with accompanying helper and utility scripts, and conda environments. Please make sure all these conda environments have been installed before running a notebook.

Additional dependencies include the [Mash reference database](https://gembox.cbcb.umd.edu/mash/refseq.genomes.k21s1000.msh) and the [Count `jar` file](https://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~csuros/gene_content/Count.jar).

Executing these notebooks one by one according to the numbering should result in a successful run of the workflow.
